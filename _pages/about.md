Hi! My name is David Bick and I am a Research Masters student in the Language Technologies Institute, at the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj, who introduced me to deep learning in 2018 during my undergrad - also at CMU - in Statistics and Machine Learning. 

My work and interests are generally in natural language processing and speech processing. My research has followed a line of work on improving the perceptual quality of machine-generated speech. I have also worked on a number of projects using recent LMs in NLP on question-answering (QA) tasks, including multimodal QA. I am generally interested in the recent development of LLM's and their emergent capabilities. 

**Research Details:**

To improve perceptual quality, we created deep learning estimators of fine-grained speech characteristics, whose importance we identified from the acoustic-phonetics literature. A useful analogy is that they are a "fingerprint" of natural speech. Our work has focused on different ways to optimize networks to produce speech that has this same "fingerprint". 

These characteristics were previously calculated using traditional _non-differentiable_ signal processing techniques. Our neural estimators are differentiable and thus open up their application in optimizing other networks. We have presented this work in 3 papers across 2 conferences, and at an invited talk to Meta Reality Labs Research Audio.
