Hi! My name is David Bick and I am a Research Masters student in the Language Technologies Institute, at the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj, who introduced me to deep learning in 2018 during my undergrad (also at CMU) in Statistics and Machine Learning. 

My work and interests are generally in natural language processing and speech processing. My research has followed a line of work on improving the perceptual quality of machine-generated speech. We did this by creating novel deep learning estimators of fine-grained speech characteristics, identified from the acoustic-phonetics literature. A useful analogy is that they are a "fingerprint" of natural speech. Our work has focused on different ways to optimize networks using these characteristics.  

I also have a number of projects using recent models in NLP (BERT/T5/GPT) on question-answering tasks. I am interested in the recent development of LLM's and the emergent capabilities at scale.
