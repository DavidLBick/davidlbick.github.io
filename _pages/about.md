Hi! My name is David Bick and I am a Research Assistant in the Language Technologies Institute, at the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. I graduated with a Master's in Language Technologies in December 2022. I am fortunate to work with -- and have been advised by -- Prof. Bhiksha Raj. He first introduced me to deep learning in 2018 during my undergrad in Statistics and Machine Learning, also at CMU. 

My work and interests are generally in natural language processing and speech processing. My research has followed a line of work on improving the perceptual quality of machine-generated speech. I have also worked on a number of projects using recent LMs in NLP on question-answering (QA) tasks, including multimodal QA. I am generally interested in the recent development of LLM's and their emergent capabilities. 

**Research Details:**

To improve perceptual quality, we created deep learning estimators of fine-grained speech characteristics, whose importance we identified from the acoustic-phonetics literature. A useful analogy is that they are a "fingerprint" of natural speech. Our work has focused on different ways to optimize networks to produce speech that has this same "fingerprint". 

These characteristics were previously calculated using traditional _non-differentiable_ signal processing techniques. Our neural estimators are differentiable and thus open up their application in optimizing other networks. In the last year we have presented this work in 3 papers across 2 conferences, and at an invited talk to Meta Reality Labs Research Audio.
